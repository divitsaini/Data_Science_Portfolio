# Data Science Portfolio - Divit Saini

I am a fellow Chemical Engineer who is currently pursuing **MSc Advanced Chemical Engineering** at **Imperial College London**. The inquisitiveness regarding Data-Driven approaches in the domain of engineering motivated me to explore the field of Data Science by completing a Post Graduate Diploma in Data Science and AI from the College of Engineering Pune, India. This portfolio entails completed Data Science end-to-end projects as well as different case studies specific to Machine Learning Algorithms. The projects are showcased in the form of jupyter notebooks implemented in Python as well as R. This is updated on a regular basis.

Every **End-to-End Projects** includes the following methodology:
1. *Introduction*: Brief introduction to the project highlingting the problem statement along with the objective of the project.

2. *Dataset Description*: A description regarding the source of the dataset along with the variables used. This also highlights the performance metrics used for comparison
4. *Importing Dataset and libraries required*
5. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Gaining insights from the dataset by exploring every dependent and independent variables. A few tasks includes checking variables for missing values; finding the range of different variables before implementing standardisation; finding correlation between the variables etc. All of this is done using pandas library in Python and dplyr in R.
6. *Data Preprocessing*: Includes tasks like imputing missing values; Standardisation/Normalisation of the numeric dependent variables
7. *Feature Engineering*: Includes tasks like One-hot encoding; Label encoding; Feature extraction techniques such as Recursive feature elimination, Backward Elimination, random forest feature importance graph.
8. *Train/Test split*: Creationg feature matrix and target array. Then Splitting them into X_train, Y_train, y_test, y_test into a certain split ratio.
9. *Modeling*: First, Machine Learning Algorithms or Deep Neural Networks is used to train different models using train dataset. Then, we test the models on the test dataset and compare their performance metrics.
10. *Saving the model*: Creating a .pkl file to be used later
11. *Conclusion*: After analysing performance metrics for different algorithms, the chosen model with best results is mentioned here with the key highlights. It also includes the future scope of the project.
12. *Deployment of the model*: This is an undergoing step and will be updated shortly.
